# E-votingsystem-using-blockchain-and-facial-recognition
 
This Blockchain-Based E-Voting System with Biometric Authentication combines blockchain technology, cryptographic tracking ID generation, and facial recognition authentication to provide a safe, transparent, and privacy-preserving electronic voting solution. A multi-chain blockchain architecture is used in this system to guarantee decentralized, tamper-proof, and verifiable elections, in contrast to conventional e-voting systems that depend on centralized databases susceptible to security breaches. By removing the possibility of impersonation, the use of facial recognition authentication ensures that only valid voters may cast ballots. To further ensure a balance between privacy and verifiability, each voter action is uniquely recorded while remaining anonymous through the use of a cryptographic tracking ID mechanism. Transaction logging and latency analysis are used to evaluate the system's performance, showing that it is scalable and has quick reaction times for large-scale elections. This project improves election integrity by utilizing blockchain's immutability and transparency.
